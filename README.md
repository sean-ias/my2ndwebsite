### Description:
<ul>
<li>For my CS50 Final Project, I implemented my personal web site, where you can find short info about me, as well as checkout my resume, blogs, and social media accounts to contact me!</li>
<li>To start with in the folder named "project", created folders for user-friendly navigation of files where there are "/files, /img, /css" folders and three ".html" files. Infiles, I have uploaded my resume to be able to show it in my website. In img, I have uploaded 2 photos of mine, as well as some other trial logos and one primary logo of my website. In css folder you can see three .css files "main.css" for index.html, "blog.css" for blog.html, and "contact.css" for contact.html.
</li>
<li>Talking about main file which is index.html, it is responsible for holding home page.</li>
</ul>
